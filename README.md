# PINN---BIOS802
Modeling Michealis-Menten Enzymes using physics informed neural networks to predict enzyme behavior.

##Software Architecture
This project will use Python in PyCharm Community Edition to model michealis menten enzyme kinectics with machine learning aspects. 

Frameworks: mainly PyTorch will be used, its autograd() function will be employed to quickly calculate gradients.
